Homeabroad247 Hotel: Streamlined Database 

This MySQL database schema caters specifically to the fictional Homeabroad247 Hotel, enabling efficient management of guest information, reservations, room details, and hotel features.
 Objectives:
Simplified Operations: Streamline guest check-in, booking handling, and data retrieval processes.
Data Integrity: Uphold accurate and reliable information through well-defined tables and relationships.
Scalability: Accommodate a growing guest base and room inventory with a flexible structure.
Future-Proof Design: Facilitate the addition of new functionalities and features as the hotel's needs evolve.

Key Entities:
Guest: This entity stores essential details about hotel patrons, including their first and last names, contact information (email address and phone number), for effective guest management.
Booking: This entity captures crucial reservation information for guest stays, such as check-in and check-out dates, the number of adults and children involved, and a reference to the associated guest for streamlined management
Floor: Tracks the different floors within the hotel.
Room Class: Categorizes various room types offered (e.g., standard, suite).
Room status: this give the present state of a particular room (e.g., vacant, occupied, housekeeping).Â 
Room: information about individual rooms, including room number, floor level, room features (e.g., standard, suite), and status are stored.
Hotel Feature: Defines amenities and services offered (e.g., Wi-Fi, minibar).
Payment: Records payment details for bookings, including payment status, method, and date.

Hotel Feature-Room Class Relationship 
(Many-to-Many): Links features with room classes, allowing a room class to have multiple features and a feature to be offered in multiple room classes.

Relationship Structure:
One-to-Many:
A guest can have many bookings.
A booking belongs to one guest.
A room belongs to one floor.
A room belongs to one room class.
A room has one status.
A booking has one payment record.

Many-to-Many:
A room class can have many features, and a feature can be associated with many room classes (achieved through the feature_has_room_class table).
A room can be linked to multiple bookings over time (not directly represented in a single table relationship, but achieved through separate relationships with the booking and room_has_booking tables).

Important Considerations:
Data Validation: Implement additional checks within the tables to ensure data accuracy (e.g., ensuring non-negative values for the number of adults and children).
Composite Primary Key: Evaluate the composite primary key in the room table. If bookings are uniquely identified by booking_id alone, consider simplifying the key.
Foreign Key Naming: Enhance clarity by using more descriptive names for foreign keys.

This well-designed schema empowers Homeabroad247 Hotel to manage its data efficiently and lays the foundation for future growth and development.
